## Description
Welcome to Bezdzioniu Kylimas! This is a 2D, platformer game where the goal is to climb to the top using platforms and avoiding traps, all while gathering various collectibles. We used Unity game engine to create this game. We chose Unity because it provided enough tools to create the game we envision and because of abundance of engine's documentation and various tutorials which allowed us to learn Unity very quickly. Also Unity has a rich asset store which allows developers to build projects quickly. The challenging part of this project was to make the movement as smooth as possible, and designing various levels with ever changing backgrounds. While this project is still in early stages of development, in the future we hope to add more levels, and make the game accessible on more platforms.
## Technical task
We had a task to develop a product using a development process type agile. Agile is a process where developers complete sprints, where at the end of each sprint, some form of a working product is developed. We chose to a develop a video game, because we both love playing video games and we wanted to see what it's like to a develop one. 
## How to Install and Run the Project
You can install the project by downloading it from this github repository, to run the game you open the downloaded file.
## How to Use the Project
When you open the project you will be presented with a main menu. Pressing the button PLAY will start the game. Pressing the button SETTINGS will allow you to adjust various settings. Pressing the button EXIT will exit the game. After starting the game you can move around using A and D keys on your keyboard(by default). To jump up to platforms use SPACE BAR on your keyboard. If you want to drop down from a platform, you can do that by pressing S on the keyboard. When you start a game, your character has a health bar that is displayed above their head. Getting hit by traps makes your health go down. When you health meter reaches 0% your character will respawn at the last checkpoint. While travelling through levels you may find some collectables. Once picked up they will be displayed on the screen. Pressing ESC key on your keyboard will pause your game and bring up the main menu.
## Testing
To test the project we did some Unit testing to make sure the code was working as intended.
